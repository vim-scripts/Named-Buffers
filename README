This plugin let's you assign names to buffers, which may later on be used to navigate to this buffer
by the assigned name. This is not very sophisticated and there are a lot of other navigation plugins,
but maybe it fits your need.

:NameBuffer resp. :NameThisBuffer let's you assign a name to a buffer.
:GotoNamedBuffer navigates to a buffer by name.
:UnnameBuffer remove a previously assigned buffer.
:ListNamedBuffers to see what names you already assigned.
